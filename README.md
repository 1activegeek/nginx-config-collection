# NGINX Server Block Configuration Collection

The goal of this repo is to be a central location for a listing of known-good working NGINX server block configurations. There is a planned format for these configurations so that it can ease the use of ensuring ALL relevant details are noted. This will include mandatory README files for EACH contribution, outlining all relevant details. The format and relevant details can be found [HERE](/contributing.md)

This repository will hopefully grow and flourish from the addition of content from others. Please share this, star it, and contribute! The more folks we have contributing to this, the better off this can become.
